# Mastering JavaScript From Zero to Production

Welcome! I'm your guide for this journey into JavaScript mastery. Across twenty lessons we will move from the absolute basics to production-grade full-stack development. Each lesson lives in its own directory with a detailed teaching note, references, and a project brief that will stretch your skills.

## How To Use This Course
- Move sequentially. Every lesson builds on the foundation of the previous one.
- Read my walkthrough in the `README.md` of each lesson first; that is your primary instruction.
- Tackle the practice drills before jumping into the project—these sharpen the specific skills you just learned.
- Use the external references and videos for reinforcement, not as substitutes for the lesson text.
- Keep a learning journal. After each lesson, capture what clicked, what felt shaky, and questions to revisit.

## Track Your Progress
- Create a branch or folder for your code experiments per lesson.
- Treat the projects like deliverables: plan, implement, test, and write a short retrospective.
- Revisit earlier lessons periodically to keep the fundamentals sharp.
