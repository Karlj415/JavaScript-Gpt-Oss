## Practice Drills
1. Write down (in your journal or notes app) why you’re learning JavaScript and how 12 months from now you want to be using it.
2. Practice the Observe → Plan → Translate → Review loop with a non-programming task (e.g., brewing coffee). Write the steps as if you were giving instructions to a robot.
3. Take screenshots of your successful tool installations. Organize them in your journal so you can troubleshoot later if needed.
4. **New:** Open the Chrome DevTools console on any webpage. Declare a variable with your name (`const myName = "Your Name";`) and then use `console.log()` to print a greeting (`console.log("Hello, " + myName);`).

## Project: Developer Profile README
Create a `README.md` in your `javascript-course-work` repository introducing yourself. Include:
- Your goals for this course.
- The tech stack you have installed.
- A checklist of habits you commit to (daily practice, journaling, peer discussions, etc.).

This may seem simple, but it starts your habit of communicating clearly—an essential skill for senior developers.
