## Practice Drills
1.  Given an array of user objects, use chaining to first `filter` for users who are active, then `map` to get an array of just their names.
2.  Use `Object.entries` and `reduce` to convert an object into a `Map`.
3.  Write a function that takes a user object. Use optional chaining (`?.`) to safely return the user's zip code (`user.address.zipCode`) or `undefined` if it doesn't exist.
4.  Use a `Set` to find the number of unique characters in a string.

## Project: Student Progress Dashboard
Create `student-dashboard.js` that:
- Maintains an array of student objects. Ensure some students are missing data (e.g., no `scores` array) to practice safe access.
- Provides functions to calculate class average, top performers, etc. **Use immutable patterns**â€”these functions should return new data, not modify the original array.
- Use `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` (chained where possible).
- Use `??` to provide default values for missing student properties (e.g., `student.name ?? 'Unknown Student'`).
- The final output should be a summary object, which you then `JSON.stringify` to simulate sending a report to a server.

// --- Functions to Implement ---

  // TODO: Return an array of names of students whose average score is above a certain threshold.
  // Hint: You'll need a helper function to calculate a single student's average.
  return []; // Placeholder

function getStudentsNeedingSupport(studentList, threshold) {
  // TODO: Return an array of names of students whose average score is below a certain threshold.
  return []; // Placeholder
}
